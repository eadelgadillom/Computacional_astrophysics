    "The **Shooting** method solves the BVP by transforming it into an initial value problem and introducing an educated choice about the unknown initial conditions on the inner boundary. Leugo, iterates using a method such as Euler, Predictor-Corrector or RK until the outer boundary is reached and it is checked if the required boundary condition is met. If it is not satisfied, the chosen initial condition is modified and the process is repeated until the boundary conditions are met.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now integrate this system of ODEs from the initial condition to the point $x=b$. Since the value $z_0$ was chosen arbitrarily, the solution found can be written as $y=y(x,z_0)$, and the goal is that this function satisfies $y(b,z_0) = B$. If the choice of $z_0$ does not achieve this goal, the function can be introduced\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The secant method is typically used to find the root because the derivative of the function $\\Phi(z)$ is not known analytically. For this method to be applied, at least two initial values $z$ need to be entered."
