It is build upon the concept of entropy and is used for calculating the difference between two probability distributions for a given random variable or set of events.\n","\n","To introduce this function, remember that *information* quantifies the number of bits required to encode and/or transmit an event. **Lower probability events have more information, higher probability events have less information**.\n","\n","In information theory is importat the notion of ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù of an event. An event is more surprising the less likely it is, meaning it contains more information. Hence: \n","\n","- **Low probability Event (surprising): More information.**\n","\n","- **Higher Probability Event (unsurprising): Less information.**\n","\n","#### Quantifying Information\n","\n","Information $h(x)$ can be calculated for an event x, given the probability of the event $P(x)$ is defined as\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","h(x) = - \\log [P(x)].\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","From this definition it is easy to check that the information associated with an event $x_1$ with probability of occurrence $P(x_1) =1$ is $h(x_1) = -\\log [1] = 0$, i.e. this event has no information associated.\n","\n","On the other hand, the information probability associated with an event $x_0$ with a low probability of occurrence $P(x_0) \\rightarrow 0$ is $h(x_0) = -\\log [P(x_0)] \\rightarrow \\infty$, i.e. this event has a large amount of information associated.\n","\n","#### Entropy \n","\n","Entropy is defined as the number of bits required to transmit a randomly selected event from a probability distribution. \n","\n","A skewed distribution has a low entropy (low information associated), whereas a distribution where events have equal probability has a larger entropy (high information associated). This fact can be undertood by noting that skewed probability distribution has less ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù and in turn a low entropy because likely events dominate.
