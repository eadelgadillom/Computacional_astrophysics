 33 Redshift was obtained from a pre-release version of the final redshift 
 33  catalogue from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (Cat. <VII/249>).
 42 This source has a redshift listed in NED that was not reported in table2 
 42   because it was considered to be unreliable.
 57 Lies so close to bright foreground stars that no optical identification is 
 57  possible from the DSS images.
 61 PKS 0454-81 appears in the scan maps, but the follow-up data were degraded 
 61  by bad weather and we did not have the opportunity to re-observe it. 
 61  For this source we obtained a flux density measurement from its 
 61  observations as a secondary calibrator in 2006 October.
 68 The spectra showed a featureless optical continuum from which no redshift 
 68  could be measured.
 73 Lies within the boundaries of the Large Magellanic Cloud and its 
 73  identification is uncertain.

 77  telescope in 2007 April and June by R. W. Hunstead and two of the authors 
 77  (P. J. Hancock and E. Mahony).

 92 (PKS 0637-752) is a quasar with an asymmetric jet seen in radio and X-ray 
 92  images (Schwartz et al., 2000ApJ...540L..69S). The tabulated flux density 
 92  is dominated by the core with about 10% in the 15-arcsec jet. It is one of 
 92  the largest (100kpc) and most luminous jets known with properties 
 92  similar to 3C273.
 98 Redshift measurement from optical spectra obtained at the ANU 2.3-m 
 98  telescope in 2007 April and June by R. W. Hunstead and two of the authors 
 98  (P. J. Hancock and E. Mahony).
109 (PMN J08355953) has a highly inverted radio spectra, with spectral index 
109  alpha^20^_5_=+0.88, but has no obvious optical counterpart. Although the 
109  Galactic latitude is relatively low (b=11{deg}), the optical extinction is 
109  only 1.1mag in the B band. The lack of optical ID suggests this could be a 
109  distant radio galaxy rather than a QSO.
138 redshift has been measured with the ESO 3.6-m telescope by P. G. Edwards and
138  his collaborators (Edwards et al., in preparation).
140 Redshift measurement from optical spectra obtained at the ANU 2.3-m 
140  telescope in 2007 April and June by R. W. Hunstead and two of the authors 
140  (P. J. Hancock and E. Mahony).
151 (PKS 1143-696) is a resolved double in the SUMSS image, and is also double 
151  in the 20-GHz image. The SUMSS source is larger than the ATCA beam at 
151  20GHz, suggesting that the measured flux density may be a lower limit to 
151  the true value. The position of the low-frequency radio centroid is 
151  slightly different from the AT20G position.
160 Lies so close to bright foreground stars that no optical identification is 
160  possible from the DSS images.
162 Redshift measurement from optical spectra obtained at the ANU 2.3-m 
162  telescope in 2007 April and June by R. W. Hunstead and two of the authors 
162  (P. J. Hancock and E. Mahony).
166 Redshift measurement from optical spectra obtained at the ANU 2.3-m 
166  telescope in 2007 April and June by R. W. Hunstead and two of the authors 
166  (P. J. Hancock and E. Mahony).
208 Redshift measurement from optical spectra obtained at the ANU 2.3-m 
208  telescope in 2007 April and June by R. W. Hunstead and two of the authors 
208  (P. J. Hancock and E. Mahony).
211 (PKS 1548-79) is a relatively nearby (z=0.15) galaxy with an unresolved 
211  radio 211  source which has a steep spectrum in our 5-, 8- and 20-GHz data.
211  The galaxy has strong optical emission lines, and has been studied in 
211  detail by Tadhunter et al. (2001MNRAS.327..227T).
221 appears to be one component of a source (PKS 1622-29) which is double 
221  (component separation ~1.5arcmin) in the NVSS image. Both components fall 
221  within the ATCA 5-GHz beam, but the 20-GHz image is centred on the eastern 
221  component and the other component falls outside the primary beam. Our 
221  measured 20-GHz flux density is therefore an underestimation of the total 
221  flux density. This source has a redshift listed in NED that was not 
221   reported in table2 because we were unable to trace back to its original 
221   source.
246 Redshift measurement from optical spectra obtained at the ANU 2.3-m 
246  telescope in 2007 April and June by R. W. Hunstead and two of the authors 
246  (P. J. Hancock and E. Mahony).
258 The AT20G source (corresponding to PKS 1932-46) is flagged as extended, and 
258  the image appears to show a compact double. The source is a 30arcsec double
258  at 5GHz (Duncan & Sproats, 1992PASAu..10...16D). The optical position given
258  in NED is associated with a z=0.231 galaxy at (J2000) 19:35:56.5 46:20:41, 
258  which is offset by 3.2arcsec from the AT20G position but appears to be the 
258  correct ID.
273 (PKS 2052-47) is a z=1.5 QSO which is also detected as both an X-ray and a 
273  gamma-ray source. Since this source is an ATCA calibrator, its flux density
273  has been monitored at several epochs during 2002-07. The calibrator data 
273  suggest that our AT20G observation of this object in 2004 October took 
273  place during the declining stage of a flaring phase, during which the flux 
273  density of the source changed rapidly. This fast change in flux and 
273  polarization properties is clearly visible in our data, with the 20-GHz 
273  flux density decreasing by a factor of 2.5 in 2d. This makes it difficult 
273  to give a reliable value for the flux density and fractional polarization 
273  of this source.
278 This source has a redshift listed in NED that was not reported in table2 
278   because we were unable to trace back to its original source.
292 (PKS 2227-3952) is a resolved triple in the SUMSS image. The low-frequency 
292  emission extends somewhat beyond the 20-GHz ATCA beam, but the source is 
292  not flagged as extended here, since the 20-GHz flux is dominated by 
292  the core.
310  flagged as extended, appears to be the core of a well-known and highly 
310  extended radio galaxy PKS 2331-240. The optical ID is a galaxy at z=0.0477.
310  The extended flux is well outside of the primary beam used for these 
310  observations and the flux densities listed correspond mainly to the core.
313 Redshift was obtained from a pre-release version of the final redshift 
313  catalogue from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (Cat. <VII/249>).
319 (PKS 2356-61) is a FanaroffRiley type II galaxy characterized by four bright
319  regions of emissions that are slightly asymmetric about the core 
319  (Burke et al., in preparation).
